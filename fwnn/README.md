# FWNN
FWNN model is a feedforward multilayer network, which combines the traditional Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy model and wavelet neural network. The core of the fuzzy system is composed of fuzzy knowledge based on the input and output data points of the system is interpreted as the language fuzzy rules.

# It's Here
I coded the FWNN's nodes in a way that is best understood to help those initially learning neural network algorithms better understand what the hidden layer does.
