# NNClassification
is a technique of classifying by neural network. At present, it provides FWNN (Fuzzy Wavelet Neural Network) algorithm model, test cases and data. In the current version, it has not added the nonlinear principal component analysis algorithm. Compared with the depth learning algorithm, this is a relatively easy to understand and learn neural network algorithm.
