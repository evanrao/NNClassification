# NNReserve
NNReserve is a technique for classifying, controlling, and predicting neural networks, including the implementation of algorithms and other open source algorithms, and its purpose is to learn and apply. Currently, it provides depth learning and FWNN (Fuzzy Wavelet Neural Network) algorithm models, test cases and sample data, and the current version does not add nonlinear principal component analysis to the algorithm.
