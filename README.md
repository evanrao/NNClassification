# NNReserve
The NNReserve is a technique of classifying, controlling and predicting using neural networks. At present, it provides FWNN (Fuzzy Wavelet Neural Network) algorithm model, test cases and sample data, and the present version has not added nonlinear principal component analysis Of the algorithm. Compared with the depth learning algorithm, FWNN is a relatively easy to learn and learn neural network algorithm.
